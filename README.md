This project tries to unify several projects for an easy-to-use and easy-to-setup custom FindMy network. The goal is to run a FindMy network without the need to own a real Mac or virtual Mac. Also you don't have to install the mail plugin or openhaystack itself. (As needed by the original OpenHaystack project).

## Setup

In this section, you will find a step-by-step guide on how to set up your own Macless-Haystack network.

<details><summary>1. Prerequisites</summary>

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed
- [Python3](https://www.python.org/) and [pip3](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) installed
- Apple-ID with 2FA enabled. Only sms/text message as second factor is supported!

<details><summary>2. Hardware setup</summary>

## Hardware setup

1. Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/dchristl/macless-haystack/releases/latest) section and download `generate_keys.py` and your needed firmware (ESP32 or NRF5x) zip file.

2. Execute the `generate_keys.py` script to generate your keypair. (Note: dependency `cryptography` is needed. Install it with `pip install cryptography`)

3. Unzip the firmware and flash it to your device (see [Install ESP32-firmware with your key](firmware/ESP32/README.md) or [Install NRF5x-firmware with your key](firmware/nrf5x/README.md))

###### Note: In general, any OpenHaystack-compatible device or its firmware is also compatible with Macless-Haystack (i.e. [the ST17H66](https://github.com/biemster/FindMy/tree/main/Lenze_ST17H66)). Typically, only the Base64-encoded advertisement key is required, which can be found in the .keys file after key generation

<details><summary>3. Server setup</summary>

## Server setup

1. Create a new docker network

```bash
docker network create mh-network
```

2. Install [Anisette Server](https://github.com/Dadoum/anisette-v3-server):

```bash
docker run -d --restart always --name anisette -p 6969:6969 --volume anisette-v3_data:/home/Alcoholic/.config/anisette-v3/lib/ --network mh-network dadoum/anisette-v3-server
```

3. Start and set up your Macless Haystack endpoint in interactive mode:

```bash
docker run -it --restart unless-stopped --name macless-haystack -p 6176:6176 --volume mh_data:/app/endpoint/data --network mh-network christld/macless-haystack
```

###### You will be asked for your Apple-ID, password and your 2FA. If you see `serving at port 6176 over HTTP` you have all set up correctly

4. Restart your server now in background by restarting it in an other terminal

```bash
docker restart macless-haystack
```

<details><summary>4. Frontend setup</summary>

## Frontend setup

You can either use the frontend provided by GitHub, host the webserver for yourself or use the Android application

- *Optional*: Mobile: Install application
- *Optional*: Host: Browse to [Github Page](https://dchristl.github.io/macless-haystack/) (s. [Notes on SSL usage](FAQ.md#how-can-i-use-ssl-if-the-endpoint-runs-on-another-machine-than-the-ui))
- Import PREFIX_devices.json to your application
- If you run the frontend not on the same machine as your endpoint, you have to configure your Url in the settings
